# Google-Hashcode-pizza-problem-solution
This is my solution for the test round problem of 2019 Google Hashcode challenge.

There is provided the solution verifier written in Python 3, so you can easy check your own solution and comapre it with mine.

The solver code is written in C++17, so you have to use a compiler that supports the standard (I use GCC 7.2).

The problem statement is placed in pizza.pdf file. All data provided by Google are in input_data directory.
